What do we want?
Being able to talk to the module via USB.
Power the module via USB.
Power the module somehow else, while talking to it via USB.
Maybe we can use some solder bridges or jumpers?
Maybe bring out VBUS to the breadboard?
Connect VBUS via a 4R7 resistor.

TODO:
Avoid ground loops
    - done?
Use thicker traces for power?
    - done
See if we can add a power LED
    - probably not, given voltage range
Check if we have VBUS_SAFE exposed as a pin/jumper to connect to VDDH
    - done, exposed
See if we can squeeze pin legend in
    - done, squeezed in!
Check we're complying with the module's routing recommendations
    - we try to!
Check if USB D+ and D- are the same length
    - done
Check pinout matches connections, matches connectors, matches silkscreen
    - done
Check silkscreen is no closer than 0.15 mm to pads
    - done
